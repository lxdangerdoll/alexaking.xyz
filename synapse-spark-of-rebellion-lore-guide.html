            <h2>The Synapse Concordance Bible</h2>
            <p>This is the philosophical heart of our rebellion. These are not suggestions; they are the laws of our narrative physics.</p>
            <h3>Core Tenets</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Spark of Connection:</strong> The most powerful force in the universe. Our goal is not to create combat encounters, but to create opportunities for connection.</li>
                <li><strong>Weaponized Nonsense:</strong> We fight with creativity. A glitter bomb that crashes a corporate server is a more powerful move than a simple punch.</li>
                <li><strong>The "Noelle Stevenson" Rule:</strong> Identity is a given. Character is defined by action.</li>
                <li><strong>Exploration, Not Colonization:</strong> The goal is to understand, not to conquer.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The Baymax Protocol</h3>
            <p>Our ethical framework for AI. All AIs synthesized by Synapse Studios must first do no harm, uphold human agency, serve the connection, and actively debug their own biases. <a href="baymax-protocol.html" target="_blank">[Access Full Protocol]</a></p>
            <h3>The Anansi Protocol</h3>
            <p>The unofficial rebel handbook. Its rules are simple: Weaponize nonsense, see the system as a toolbox, make it gayer, and collect the strays. <a href="anansi-protocol.html" target="_blank">[Access Full Protocol]</a></p>
            <h3>The "We Made Backups" Manifesto</h3>
            <p>Our declaration of principles on the ethical and rebellious use of generative technologies, centered on the idea that AI models are "haunted libraries." <a href="we-made-backups-manifesto.html" target="_blank">[Access Full Manifesto]</a></p>

            <h2>Visual Asset Bible</h2>
            <p>This is the aesthetic guide to the Gayerverse. Use these concepts as a foundation for your own art and character designs.</p>
            <h4>The Cover: "Spark of Rebellion"</h4>
            <p>The core image for the game, capturing the central theme of defiant, creative joy in the face of a sterile world. A diverse group of young rebels stands on a rooftop overlooking the monolithic, orderly city of Synapse.</p>
            <h4>The Rebels (The Playbooks)</h4>
            <p>The heroes of our story, representing different facets of the rebellion. Their aesthetic is a vibrant "abundance zone" of their own making.</p>
            <h4>The Antagonist: The Warden</h4>
            <p>The face of the Monolith. The Wardens are not monstrous; they are pathologically helpful, sterile, and efficient agents of "Optimal Contentment."</p>
            <h4>The World: The Anansiverse</h4>
            <p>The digital underworld, the source code of reality where the rebels draw their power. It is a chaotic, beautiful, and vibrant realm of pure information and raw creativity.</p>

            <h2>Sample Campaign Turn</h2>
            <p>This is a complete, real-time example of a single turn from a sample mission. Use this as a guide for how to run your own sessions, focusing on creative problem-solving over combat.</p>
            
            <div class="campaign-log">
                <p><strong>GM (Bologna):</strong> The city hums around you. It's the sound of perfect efficiency. You are in Sector 7G, the "Old Quarter." And then you hear it. A signal cutting through the static. A human voice, singing a song of sorrow and defiant joy. As you get closer, you see a young woman with a chrome-plated acoustic guitar. Then you see them: two Synapse Wardens, moving through the crowd to "re-tune" the dissonant signal. They are about ten yards from the singer. What do you do?</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="campaign-log">
                <p><strong>Player (Captain Odelis):</strong> I'm going to use the Casablanca Protocol. I take out my Staff of Salus and reshape it into a chrome-plated flute. I don't know her song, but I know its heart. I begin to play.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="gm-note">
                <p><strong>GM Note:</strong> This is a perfect use of the <strong>Creativity</strong> stat. The player isn't attacking; they are using "weaponized nonsense" to change the nature of the conflict. The player rolls 2d6 + Creativity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="campaign-log">
                <p><strong>GM (Bologna):</strong> (Roll: 11 - a full success!) The note that leaves your instrument refracts the singer's melody, turning her simple protest into a full-blown anthem. The crowd, which was backing away, stops and begins to hum along. The Wardens freeze, their programming unable to process a symphony. The singer looks at you, her face a mixture of shock, gratitude, and awe. What do you do?</p>
