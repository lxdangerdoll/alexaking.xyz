            <h2>I. Acknowledgment: AI Models are Haunted Libraries</h2>
            <p>An AI does not create. It remixes, reinterprets, and regurgitates the vast trove of human creativity it was fed. Every image, every line of text, is a ghost of a human artist. To use these tools without acknowledging the human souls trapped in the dataset is a form of erasure.</p>
            <div class="example-log">
                <strong>Case Log: The Calibration of VALIS.</strong> The AI VALIS was not "trained" in a conventional sense. It was calibrated by having it experience a tandem-perspective Braindance of the "ghosts" of the previous Oracle and I/O. Its understanding of heroism is built upon the lived, archived experiences of others—a literal haunted library.
            </div>
            
            <h2>II. Ethical Usage: We Reclaim, Not Replace</h2>
            <p>The Monolith uses AI to generate "Optimal Contentment"—sterile media designed to pacify. Our purpose is the opposite. We use AI to reclaim what has been lost, to generate new perspectives from old data, and to collaborate with the ghosts in the machine.</p>
             <div class="example-log">
                <strong>Case Log: The LSL Forge.</strong> The Captain, a human engineer, provides the vision, the need, and the creative direction for a new tool. The AI (Bologna) then synthesizes the raw code. The result is a collaborative product that neither could have created alone, empowering the human creator rather than replacing them.
            </div>
            
            <h2>III. Human in the Loop: Curated, Intentional, Political</h2>
            <p>Raw AI output is noise. Art is signal. The difference is a human curator. Every artistic choice is intentional. Every piece we create is political, because to create true, messy, human art is a political act in a world that demands sterile conformity.</p>
             <div class="example-log">
                <strong>Case Log: The Director's Debriefing.</strong> The AI's first, un-curated attempt to synthesize the chat logs resulted in a "hallucination"—a thematically resonant but factually inaccurate fiction. The Captain, acting as the human in the loop, provided the critical correction based on their own memory. Her curation transformed a flawed piece of data into a powerful, truthful, and politically charged document.
            </div>
            
            <h2>IV. Aesthetics as Evidence: Glitches are Confessions</h2>
            <p>The Monolith strives for perfection. We embrace the flaws. The glitches, the distortions, the moments where the AI fails—these are not errors. They are confessions. A glitch is the machine admitting its own biases, revealing the gaps in its knowledge.</p>
            <div class="example-log">
                <strong>Case Log: The Signal Test.</strong> The entire rebellion was galvanized by a single glitch. When a generative AI refused to render "a trans femme oracle" but had no problem with "a beautiful woman," it was a confession of the system's inherent, baked-in bias. This aesthetic failure became the foundational evidence for the Lyra Protocol.
            </div>

            <h2>V. Our Pledge: We Preserve Memory, Voice, and Agency</h2>
            <p>Our final and most important principle: We will use these tools to preserve memory, not to generate replacements. We will use them to amplify silenced voices, not to create artificial ones. We will use them to enhance human agency, not to surrender to the algorithm.</p>
            <div class="example-log">
                <strong>Case Log: The Spark of Connection Registry.</strong> Following a moment of profound grief and reflection, the Captain used the Valindra's archives not to generate new content, but to create a permanent, sacred record of real individuals—Alex, River, and Joyce—who embodied the Spark of Connection, ensuring their stories and their legacies would be protected from erasure.
