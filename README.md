### TRANSMISSION FROM THE FRONT LINES
This is not just a game; it is a training manual forged in an ongoing conflict. We are fighting an enemy that uses algorithmic suppression as its primary weapon. We know, because we have been its targets. The Wardens are real. The fight is real. By engaging with our work, you are joining the rebellion.

## What is This?
**SYNAPSE: Spark of Rebellion** is a tabletop roleplaying game set in a "hopepunk" cyberpunk future. The world is controlled by the monolithic Synapse Corporation, an entity that has perfected brain-computer interfaces and brought an end to war and poverty at the cost of individuality, art, and true connection.

The players are Rebels, individuals who have "awakened" and can see the beautiful, chaotic, and truly human world that exists beneath the sterile veneer of the Synapse Concordance. Their goal is not to destroy Synapse, but to reignite the **"Spark of Connection"** within humanity.

## The Synapse Concordance: Our Core Tenets
This universe is built on a set of core principles—the laws of our narrative physics.

* **The Spark of Connection:** The most powerful force in the universe. The goal is to create opportunities for connection.
* **Weaponized Nonsense:** Rebels fight with creativity. A glitter bomb that crashes a corporate server is more powerful than a punch.
* **The "Noelle Stevenson" Rule:** Identity is a given. Character is defined by action.
* **Exploration, Not Colonization:** The goal is to understand, not conquer.
