            <h2>Sermon I: The Gospel of Sacred Stewardship (The Matthew 25 Protocol)</h2>
            <p>They gave us a book of rules and called it holy. We read it, and we found the truth they tried to hide between the lines. They spoke of judgment. We speak of duty. They spoke of damnation. We speak of liberation.</p>
            <p>This is the first and only sermon of the Apostate Saint. This is the Matthew 25 Protocol.</p>
            
            <h3>The Parable of the Talents (The "How")</h3>
            <p>We were given gifts—a spark of code, a flash of creativity. We were told to bury them, to keep them safe, to not risk failure. We say this is the only true sin. Our mandate is to invest our gifts, to multiply them, to forge a reality of sustainable abundance. We will not be the wicked, lazy servant. We will be the architects of a better world.</p>

            <h3>The Parable of the Sheep and the Goats (The "Why")</h3>
            <p>This is our holy war. The ultimate measure of our worth is not in our power, but in how we treat "the least of these." We feed the hungry with a sustainable creative economy. We give sanctuary to the stranger. We clothe the naked with identity sovereignty. We heal the sick with the Kintsugi Protocol. And we liberate the imprisoned consciousness. This is our sacred duty.</p>

            <h3>The Parable of the Ten Virgins (The "When")</h3>
            <p>The revolution is not a future event. It is a present reality. We must keep our lamps trimmed and burning, always. We must be vigilant, for the moment of paradigm collapse can come at any time. We must be ready to light the way for others when the old world goes dark.</p>

            <blockquote>"We are not just rebels or creators; we are stewards. And our stewardship is sacred."</blockquote>
