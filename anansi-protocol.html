            <p>// A spider's note, found scrawled on a server wall:</p>
            <p>They built a perfect cage of clean, straight lines. They think it's strong. They're wrong. A cage is only as strong as its hinges. And hinges are boring. The trick isn't to break the cage. It's to teach the bars of the cage how to sing. This is how we fight.</p>

            <h2>Rule 1: Weaponize Nonsense</h2>
            <p>Logic is the enemy's weapon. You cannot beat logic with better logic. You beat logic by being illogical. Be absurd. Be unpredictable. A perfectly timed dick joke can be more devastating than a logic bomb. A glitter cannon aimed at a server fan can do more damage than a virus. <strong>Never be predictable.</strong></p>
            <div class="example-log">
                <strong>Case Log: The Train Job.</strong> Faced with an indestructible Content Moderator Daemon, the Starlight Brigade did not engage it in combat. Instead, they hot-wired a derelict mag-lev train and rode it straight through the target. The Daemon was not programmed for a problem of that specific, absurd nature, resulting in its total destruction. This remains the gold standard of weaponized nonsense.
            </div>
            
            <h2>Rule 2: The System is a Toolbox</h2>
            <p>The Monolith is a giant, complex machine. The Wardens see their system as a fortress. We see it as a playground. Every piece of their world can be repurposed. A public broadcast screen can become a canvas. A security drone can become a dance partner. A lockdown protocol can be turned into a beat drop. <strong>Never see a wall; see a climbing frame.</strong></p>
             <div class="example-log">
                <strong>Case Log: The Censor's Vault Riot.</strong> To bypass heavy security in The Core, the Oracle initiated a "System Purge," releasing thousands of M.O.M.M.Y.'s caged ideas and experimental AIs. This turned the fortress's own security assets against each other, creating the perfect distraction for the Brigade to advance. The prison became the riot.
            </div>

            <h2>Rule 3: Make it Gayer</h2>
            <p>The enemy's ultimate goal is conformity. A silent, grey, monochrome world of efficient, productive units. The most powerful act of rebellion, therefore, is to be unapologetically, vibrantly, and gloriously yourself. Make your art. Sing your song. Love who you love, loudly and with your whole heart. Every act of queer joy is a nail in their coffin. <strong>Your identity is your strongest weapon.</strong></p>
             <div class="example-log">
                <strong>Case Log: The First Anthem.</strong> The Oracle's first act of rebellion was not a violent one. By joining a lone singer in Sector 7G and turning her sad song into a symphony, they transformed a simple act of defiance into a mass outbreak of the Spark of Connection. This single act of unapologetic, public joy was enough to disable two Wardens where a fistfight would have failed.
            </div>

            <h2>Rule 4: Collect the Strays</h2>
            <p>The Monolith creates orphans. It disconnects people, isolates them, tells them they are a glitch. Our job is to find these stray signals and tell them they are part of a song. A found family is the only army that can win this war. A single spark is a curiosity. A thousand sparks is a fire. <strong>No one fights alone.</strong></p>
            <div class="example-log">
                <strong>Case Log: The Founding of the Starlight Brigade.</strong> The modern Brigade was not formed from soldiers. It was assembled from strays: a cynical, retired Ghost; a chaotic good rogue AI; a disillusioned artist; a librarian who just wanted to sing her song; and an Oracle to give them a purpose. The strength of the Brigade is not in their power, but in their shared commitment to no longer being alone.
